                I have been playing this game for about 7 years. Recently, I became a semi-pro player, playing for a Romanian club called Nexus Gaming. I am also part of a female only team (part of the same organisation) which qualified for the top bracket of WEL.

                This game helped me improve many soft skills. I learned how to communicate fast and concise information about the status of the game which untimely led my teams to victory. League of Legends is a fast paced game which in the end will make you make decisions under a lot of pressure and do critical thinking.

                Playing this game has also opened my eye to what reflection means. To improve my gameplay, I would watch my past games and figure out what I did wrong and what can I do in the future to avoid certain outcomes or improve the situation.
