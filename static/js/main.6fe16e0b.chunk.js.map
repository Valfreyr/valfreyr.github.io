Back in 2015 there was a contest about educational apps called “History and society in the virtual dimension”. We were supposed to design and create an application which can be used by a teacher to teach their subject in a unique way. I saw it as an opportunity for me to design something oriented more towards gaming, because when you game you get a lot of interaction with everything and the player is more immersed in the action. That means it could be a lot easier for a student to learn and retain new information.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p >\r\n                I chose psychology because I thought I could introduce a story to exemplify all the characteristics of the human mind. I also thought it would be a good idea to let the players tailor the story because at the end I added a little surprise. They could see their personality type and I thought because they knew the reason behind their choices they would understand everything better.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                Each chapter is supposed to make you experience a different emotion. First one is fear, second one is shame/embarrassment, third one is frustration and the last one is happiness or sadness depending on your options. I mostly chose negative feelings because they make people act and behave irrationally since their judgment is clouded by those emotions. My psychology teacher helped me make the story and the personality test as accurate as possible\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                The version on Google Drive is not the final version. It is the version that won first place on county level in the competition.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                The version which won bronze medal on the national level (out of 100 contestants) had 2D scenes when the story was a bit more dynamic. For example, in chapter one it is late at night and you feel like you are chased by the darkness around you, the player had to run away and find their room (based on a description) where they felt safe. The player and the environment were sprites and the animations were done frame by frame. Moreover, it had notifications when there was more information added to the info tab in the menu. The game had the option to pause when you pressed escape, letting you choose either between settings, exiting the game or reading more about what happened in the story and the explanation from a psychological point of view.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                The reason why I don’t have the final version anymore is because, back then, my hard drive failed and I lost everything on it. I did not know what source control was nor how to use it. I was one of the hardest lessons I’ve learned in 2015. Looking back, I deeply regret not researching how a proper project was done.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                I’ve only managed to recover an old version and some pictures that were taken during the development of the game. (Spoilers, back then I did not know what a screenshot is.) Below you can see some pictures taken with my phone of the scene described above and also another scene in chapter 2 where the player has to interact with other characters to achieve his goal (impressing the girl surrounded by a lot of guys). To do that the players needs to talk with almost everyone in the room and to pick dialog lines which will result in different outcomes.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                This educational game also won second place at “InfoEducatie”.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            <div>\r\n              <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1moXxYVW-f3Cxm6krNQ9g5wNIzFmKUg0r\" target=\"_blank\"><button>Click here to see the project</button></a>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class = \"gallery\">\r\n                <MyGallery />\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst images = [\r\n    {\r\n        original: p3,\r\n         thumbnail: p3,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        original: p4,\r\n        thumbnail: p4,\r\n    },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p5,\r\n        thumbnail: p5,\r\n      },\r\n     \r\n      {\r\n        original: p9,\r\n        thumbnail: p9,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p10,\r\n        thumbnail: p10,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p11,\r\n        thumbnail: p11,\r\n      },\r\n      \r\n      {\r\n        original: p13,\r\n        thumbnail: p13,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p15,\r\n        thumbnail: p15,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p16,\r\n        thumbnail: p16,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p18,\r\n        thumbnail: p18,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p21,\r\n        thumbnail: p21,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p23,\r\n        thumbnail: p23,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p24,\r\n        thumbnail: p24,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p25,\r\n        thumbnail: p25,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p26,\r\n        thumbnail: p26,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p27,\r\n        thumbnail: p27,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p28,\r\n        thumbnail: p28,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p29,\r\n        thumbnail: p29,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p30,\r\n        thumbnail: p30,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p31,\r\n        thumbnail: p31,\r\n      },\r\n  ];\r\n   \r\n  class MyGallery extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n      return <ImageGallery style={{width: \"100px\", height: \"200px\"}} items={images} />;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default Memories; ","import React from 'react'; \r\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\r\nimport p1 from './Xmas/xmas.png'\r\nimport p2 from './Xmas/xellah.png'\r\nimport p3 from './Xmas/witch.png'\r\nimport p4 from './Xmas/tree.png'\r\nimport p5 from './Xmas/page.png'\r\n\r\nconst Xmas = () => { \r\n    return ( \r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>X-Mas</h1><hr/>\r\n            <div class = \"default-text\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                This was the second game I created.

I wanted to add 2 characters which would represent the voice in his head. Imagine it as if you were having a conversation with yourself.

In our modern times this tool has been used for a wide range of activities such as medical diagnosis, aviation, Deepfake etc. \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n            Another use of AI is for video gaming. It is normally used to mimic human like behaviour in NPCs (non-player characters) and thus creating an immersive gameplay world. A human can react and adapt to changes of the environment in real time, however, whereas an AI is more rigid due to mainly consisting of hard coded behaviours. A behaviour tree is used to help the AI make decisions and most of the time it does not take into account all the factors from the game, resulting in repetitive, simple or abnormal behaviour.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>\r\n                The Problem\r\n            </h2><hr/>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n            Throughout the history of gaming AIs have been scrutinised for hindering players due to their pre-defined logic and only recently have they started to provide a more immersive experience by reacting faster than the player does. Some might think that this type of simple AI is sufficient for games, however in some scenarios, such as in competitive games, it can be rewarding to have a challenging non-player opponent or ally.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n            Modern computers can deal with large amount of data, but processing speed and memory can still be an issue if too much data is available. To view the opposite side of this problem, an AI can also be limited by the amount of information it can gather on its own. This sensory limitation can restrict the way it processes the environment, thus decreasing the operations it can do to achieve its goal. Nevertheless, an AI is expected to do a whole range of activities such as critical decision making, reacting fast to a new or unpredicted event, recover from a position where it has deviated from the main goal, and many more. Such tasks can only be accomplished if the system knows how to switch between sub-goals and different “thinking” methods even when some of the data is missing.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n            Putting all these constraints together, a real-time AI must reliably accomplish complex critical operations under realistic resource limitations in a dynamic environment. \r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>\r\n                Aims\r\n            </h2><hr/>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n            The project aims to develop a simple real time environment where then an AI can be trained to learn the mechanics of gameplay. It also aims to understand how an AI can make these real time decisions and how could you improve the decision making system while gathering data and dealing with unforeseen events. \r\n            </p>  \r\n\r\n             <h4>\r\n                Source code available on request.\r\n            </h4>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class = \"gallery\">\r\n                <MyGallery />\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst images = [\r\n    {\r\n        original: p1,\r\n        thumbnail: p1,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        original: p2,\r\n        thumbnail: p2,\r\n    },\r\n  ];\r\n\r\nclass MyGallery extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n      return <ImageGallery style={{width: \"100px\", height: \"200px\"}} items={images} />;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\nexport default RTS; ","import React from 'react'; \r\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\r\nimport p1 from './UniProjects/graphics.png'\r\nimport p2 from './UniProjects/p1.png'\r\nimport p3 from './UniProjects/p2.png'\r\nimport p4 from './UniProjects/p3.png'\r\nimport p5 from './UniProjects/unknown-27.png'\r\n\r\nconst Uni = () => { \r\n    return ( \r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>University Projects</h1><hr/>\r\n            <div class = \"default-text\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                During my third university year I have been working on interesting coursework projects.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>\r\n                Programming for Game Module\r\n                </h2><hr/>\r\n\r\n                <p>  \r\n                My first coursework was on memory allocation.

I became their League of Legends Esports Officer. My responsibilities were to ensure our League of Legends teams were ready to compete, organise events with NUEL and resolve any conflicts between our members.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                To get this award I had have at least 50 hours of activities in both semesters and prove that I achieved or improved certain skills. Those skills were Peer assessment/review, Problem-solving and Adaptability.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>\r\n                Peer assessment/review story\r\n                </h2> <hr/>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                When the new NUEL/NSE split started this academic year I was a substitute player for my team. This meant I wouldn’t be able to play as much as I wanted to. It made me extremely upset and I was desperate to find something to get myself more involved in the society.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                I realised, since my knowledge and level of understanding of the game was higher than anyone else’s, I can watch their games and try to help them by analysing their mistakes. I talked with every team and I told them I am happy to work with them so that they can improve. After I posted that message everyone started asking me for 1 on 1 sessions which I was happy to provide.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                My goal was to identify mistakes and then provide different strategies and tools so the errors would not happen again. This required watching multiple games of a team playing together or a single player. I recorded their games and noted in-game timers so that the person who is viewing the feedback can easily see and understand what they could have done better.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                For 1 on 1 sessions I would get the player to see a map of the game and depending on the role they played on the team, I would show them different strategies and important spots they had to keep in mind.\r\n                After a few sessions like this, the teams started winning more games and one even qualified for the NSE regionals finals. Individual players also improved. Their rank got higher and they were extremely happy with the results (in the game the highest rank is 1).\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>\r\n                Problem-solving story\r\n                </h2> <hr/>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                This year (2019), I had the opportunity to run for League of Legends eSports Manager. I saw this as a great chance for me to change something. A lot of people were complaining about the “Tryout period” – a time where players would organise their teams. Some wanted to play the game in a serious way whereas others just wanted to have fun.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                I spent the winter break considering this. Over time I asked for feedback from players about my ideas. Upon gathering enough information, I wrote a registration form.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The “Tryout period” was changed from 2 hours to 2 weeks. This was necessary because it takes more than a day to get to know someone’s full potential in the game, since ability varies over time they may have had a bad day or were not comfortable with the equipment we provided at the venue. I then introduced 2 different types of teams just like the players wanted. A “Pro” team where they were encouraged to create a schedule and practice together a lot more than before and where they were also given a coach and a “Casual” team where they would continue playing as they did before with no extra rules or obligations. The “Pro” team also had a strike system: a player would get a strike if they missed a training session or a match day without a good reason. This was introduced to make sure that everyone in the team was sharing the same goal and they were putting in the same effort. After 2 strikes, with the captain’s agreement, the player was removed from the team.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                This system was a success; most of the players were feeling better in their teams thus their teamwork and performance improved. Most teams placed higher in the tournament than last year.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>\r\n                Adaptability story\r\n                </h2> <hr/>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                This year (2019) Newcastle’s Gaming Society hosted the charity event Gameblast. The main event featured many games for people to enjoy. There was also a Twitch livestream where Newcastle’s teams would face Durham’s teams in various games. These matches were on the front page of Twitch which meant I could attract a lot of viewers/potential donors.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                My counterpart at Durham and I had a few Discord (like Skype) calls where we talked about what we would do with the stream. Each game had a 2-hour slot to provide entertainment for the stream. \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                He had a lot of ideas, but I decided it was better to do a risk analysis. There were so many things that could go badly: computers not working, internet problems, matches being too long or too short or even the fact that the teams were not balanced and most of the matches could be one-sided. I suggested it was better for us to take a different approach, by starting off with a normal match then making one person play on the mouse and another one on the keyboard to add variety. This was a great idea; players found it enjoyable, the commentator had an easier time and we had a lot more people watching the stream.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                On the day, there was a thing we didn’t take into account. The university forgot to put internet on the computers resulting in a 30-minute delay. This meant we couldn’t stick to the initial plan. I was quick to react and decided to focus only on the main matches, thus leaving out other game modes we discussed.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The day ended up being a complete success because everyone said the League of Legends part of the stream was the best part and we managed to collect over 500 pounds for charity.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class = \"gallery\">\r\n                <MyGallery />\r\n            </div> \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nconst images = [\r\n    {\r\n        original: p1,\r\n        thumbnail: p1,\r\n    },\r\n  ]; \r\n\r\n  \r\nclass MyGallery extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n      return <ImageGallery style={{width: \"100px\", height: \"200px\"}} items={images} />;\r\n    }\r\n  } \r\n\r\nexport default Ncl; ","import React from 'react'; \r\n\r\n\r\nconst Lol = () => { \r\n    return ( \r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>League of Legends</h1><hr/>\r\n            <div class = \"default-text\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                I have been playing this game for about 7 years. Recently, I became a semi-pro player, playing for a Romanian club called Nexus Gaming. I am also part of a female only team (part of the same organisation) which qualified for the top bracket of WEL.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                This game helped me improve many skills. I learned how to communicate fast and concise information about the status of the game which ultimately led my teams to victory. League of Legends is a fast paced game which in the end will make you make decisions under a lot of pressure and do critical thinking.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Playing this game has also opened my eye to what reflection means. To improve my gameplay, I would watch my past games and figure out what I did wrong and what can I do in the future to avoid certain outcomes or improve the situation. \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                <a href= \"http://nexusesports.ro/\" target=\"_blank\"> You can visit their website here. </a>\r\n                \r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Lol; ","import React from 'react'; \r\nimport ImageGallery from 'react-image-gallery';\r\n\r\nimport p1 from './Films/11071505_1073760285984200_6826171892729461459_n.jpg'\r\nimport p2 from './Films/IMG-20150325-WA0025.jpg'\r\nimport p3 from './Films/IMG-20150327-WA0003.jpeg'\r\nimport p4 from './Films/IMG-20150327-WA0005.jpeg'\r\nimport p5 from './Films/IMG-20160412-WA0005.jpg'\r\nimport p6 from './Films/mindjackD.PNG'\r\n\r\nconst Films = () => { \r\n    return ( \r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>My Films</h1><hr/>\r\n            <div class = \"default-text\">\r\n                <p>\r\n                Infomatrix competition had a multimedia section as well, where contestant would have to produce a short film with different themes. In 2015 we were supposed to show why burglary was bad. I wanted to add a futuristic vibe to it so I decided to create a world where people could enter other people’s mind and steal any kind of information. Getting that information would not be that easy because the subconscious of the invaded person would manifest like laser beans and other kind of traps to the invader. If they triggered one of the alarm systems, the target would instantly know they got attacked and by who. The short film is called Mindjack and it won a bronze medal at national level.\r\n                <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvrvIdyRVAo\" target=\"_blank\"> Click here to see the video. </a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The film above was filmed and edited in After Effects in a week without prior knowledge of the software or how to actually shoot a short film.

Together with a few friends, we decided to accept this challenge and see what it would be like to start a gaming indie company. We called it Helix Corp/ Cyber Helix.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                At the beginning we had to build a website which was a big challenge on its own because we barely started learning what a programming language is. Then, we had to register the company and wait for the government to issue and ID for it. I remember we had to do a lot of paper work for it, such as figuring out how much money we’d make and lose or how we were planning on getting on the market and what sort of adverting we’d do.\r\n                </p>  \r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                I decided to make a short ad.\r\n                <a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbplk9ykJEM&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\"> Click here to see the video. </a>\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                We were given virtual money which could had been used on their platform to perform negotiations, do marketing actions and perform different kind of transactions.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The whole project lasted a few months and it provided a few workshops on teamwork and communication.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The final step was to attend a companies’ fair and present our progress and company.

Some ships had more health and different shapes. The goal was to use as less shots as possible and win the game. I was in a team with my best friend and had 12 hours to finish this algorithm. Out of 50 people we finished top 10.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Another event was about building a restaurant app in 2 days. It was another duo project. There was a QR code the phone was supposed to scan to inform the app about the user and the table he/she was sat at.  Then, the app had a menu which could had been used to order food and drinks without needing to wait for someone to get the order. Unfortunately, my server side and android knowledge at that time was not that good so we ended up not completing the app. This resulted in us not getting a prize and thus I cannot remember the name of the competition.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The same event as the one above also had a 4-hour challenge to create logos for a fictive company called Programmer’s Nest. I made a tree that grows out of spinning cog wheels. The cogs would symbolise the intellectual power of the programmers and the tree would be the produced apps. The jury did not like my logo and so I did not receive any awards.   \r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                In my final year of high-school I joined a robotics contest called First Tech Challenge. I helped design the logo for the team and build some of the robot’s sensors. I remember the team got to the national stage but I don’t remember how they performed. I was not allowed to continue my work with them because I was about to graduate and had to focus on my final exams.\r\n                <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/harambecartel/?epa=SEARCH_BOX\" target=\"_blank\">You can visit their Facebook page here </a>\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                Nowadays, I enjoy going to different types of meetups in Newcastle such as Ministry of Testing, OWASP and different sorts of gaming related ones.\r\n                </p>  \r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class = \"gallery\">\r\n                <MyGallery />\r\n            </div> \r\n        </div>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nconst images = [\r\n    {\r\n        original: p1,\r\n        thumbnail: p1,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        original: p2,\r\n        thumbnail: p2,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        original: p3,\r\n         thumbnail: p3,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        original: p4,\r\n        thumbnail: p4,\r\n    },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p5,\r\n        thumbnail: p5,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p6,\r\n        thumbnail: p6,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p7,\r\n        thumbnail: p7,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p8,\r\n        thumbnail: p8,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p9,\r\n        thumbnail: p9,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p10,\r\n        thumbnail: p10,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p11,\r\n        thumbnail: p11,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p12,\r\n        thumbnail: p12,\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        original: p13,\r\n        thumbnail: p13,\r\n      },\r\n  ];
